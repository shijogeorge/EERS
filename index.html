      <p><b>Objective: To develop a standalone application program to record the following:</b>
      <br>
      (i)  University visitor’s information.
      (ii) Hostel student’s information for going on vacation, stay outside beyond scheduled time,and stay outside for a day/days and for the class leave.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Problem Statement: In the existing system the data is recorded in a piece of paper having some limited amount of information.
      </b>
      <br>
      In College:It is difficult to find out the information for a particular visitor and it also consumes a lot of valuable time. Also it does not contain the photo proof of the visitor.
      At Hostel: It is difficult to maintain the records of the students who with/without informing the warden stay out for different purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
      Proposed Plan: The present system will be digitalized.The proposed system is an attempt to provide a solution to the drawbacks of the existing system.
      </b>
      <br>
      (i) Photograph of the visitor will be included in the form.
      (ii)  Data Backup Advantage: Visitors data is uploaded into the web server then and there.
      (iii) Security:  Data will be secure in any sort of software crash.
       (iv) Easy retrieval of information of the Hostellers and Visitors.
